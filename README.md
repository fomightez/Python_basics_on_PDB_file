# Python_basics_on_PDB_file
Python basics exploring a PDB file for session #3 of [Upstate Medical University's **GS647-021 Nanocourse: Structuring against Coronavirus**](https://github.com/fomightez/UpstateGS647-021Nanocourse/wiki)

## Guidance on what you'll see in the sessions launched from here

Needed?

#### Visual debugger

The Visual Debugger extension is there to allow you to step through and understand code that is running. You have to use the `xpython` kernel to have access to the debugger. What kernel us being used is indicated in the upper right above the running notebook. You'll either see a 'Python 3' or 'xpython' next to the indicator of whether code is being actively processed. If you are using the vanilla 'Python 3' kernel at present, you can switch kernels to use the debugger. Two ways to switch: 1) In the menubar select `Kernel` > `Change kernel...` and select `xpython` in the choice listing; or 2) left-click on the kernel name in the upper right and toggle the choice to `xpython`. Keep in mind that switching will clear the current computational 'state', and so you would need to run again any previously run code. To give you a sense of how to use the debugger, can see the [debugger demonstrated](https://github.com/jupyterlab/debugger#jupyterlabdebugger) in an animated gif [here](https://github.com/jupyterlab/debugger#jupyterlabdebugger). A notebook similar to the one in the demonstration gif is available in the running session as 'debugger demo.ipynb'.
